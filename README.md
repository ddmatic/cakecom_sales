#Intro

For this task, I have used Python to preprocess data. 

Two datasets were created from the original (Absolute and Like for Like), even though only one was used for the Tableau dashboard. 

From existing variables, a few more were derived:
-Actual Sales
-Cost of Goods Sold
-Front Margin
-Gross Margin
-Is Promo?
These should help us track what is happening with our sales.

Absolute shows trends in the company as is, growth included. L4L would exclude growth (e.g. Sales location) and only show sales changes based on the previous year.
This is because adding Like for Like analysis would require much more slides over the 10-slide limit. 
(Even now itâ€™s more, but excluding welcome, intro, and conclusion it fits the requirement)
